### Project Title: Topic Modeling and Clustering on Real-world Text Data using LDA and K-Means

**Objective:** To uncover latent topics and group similar documents from the 20 Newsgroups dataset using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and K-Means clustering. This helps in organizing and summarizing large unstructured text data efficiently.

**Dataset:** [20 Newsgroups](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Twenty+Newsgroups) â€” 20,000 documents from 20 categories such as sports, politics, science, etc.

**Approach:** Applied two unsupervised learning methods:  
- **K-Means** on TF-IDF vectors for document clustering  
- **LDA** on Bag-of-Words for topic modeling  
We compared their performance using evaluation metrics and visualizations.
